# What is jWebSocket ? #

**jWebSocket is a pure Java/JavaScript high speed bidirectional communication solution for the Web**<br />
The jWebSocket project has been initiated to create innovative HTML5 based streaming and communication applications on the web. HTML 5 WebSockets will replace the existing XHR approaches as well as Comet services by a new flexible and ultra high speed bidirectional TCP socket communication technology. jWebSocket is an open source Java and JavaScript implementation of the HTML 5 WebSocket protocol with a huge set of extensions. The jWebSocket package contains:
  * **jWebSocket server**<br />a pure Java based WebSocket server for server-to-client (S2C) streaming solutions and server controlled (C2C) client-to-client-communication.
  * **jWebSocket client**<br />a pure JavaScript based WebSocket client with JSON support and an optional user, session and timeout-management. No plug-ins required.
# Why should I use it ? #
**jWebSocket speeds up your web application and provides innovative new communication features**<br />
With jWebSockets you can easily create market tickers, news feeds, chat applications, social networks or online collaboration suites. jWebSocket provides a wide range of functionality from a basic token exchange up to powerful data and GUI synchronization, remote procedure calls und much more! With jWebSocket you can quickly set up a stand-alone solution with a minimum of installation and configuration or you can easily integrate it into your existing applications.
  * **bidirectional**<br />TCP communication on a single socket for more concurrent client/server connections, supported by HTML 5 compliant browsers.
  * **much quicker**<br />compared to Comet and the various XHR approaches, all polling and stay-open mechanisms become obsolete.
  * **more responsive**<br />due to less latency, less brand-width requirements and less overhead due to light-weight TCP socket communication instead of HTTP.
  * **standardized**<br />technology specified by W3C  and IETF , easy interplay with proxies and firewalls.
